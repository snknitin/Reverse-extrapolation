# Reverse-extrapolation
Time-series and textual data


# Abstract

An interesting idea that we can actually test for. Instead of predicting the future from present trends, this is a project about retrospecting unseen past and confirming if the pattern in the trend is actually captured properly.This presents a viable method of testing since we can hold out the data.
