# Reverse-extrapolation
Time-series and textual data


# Abstract

An interesting idea that we can actually test for. Instead of predicting the future from present trends, this is a project about retrospecting unseen past and confirming if the pattern in the trend is actually captured properly.This presents a viable method of testing since we can hold out the data. 

Sometimes people tend to start watching a show mid way but get the gist of what happened previously due to recurring hints or information provided by extrapolating backwards and understanding what might have happened. This is why you can watch most movies without seeing the prequels. Most authors also structure their writing in a way that an inattentive reader doesn't have to re-read the chapter or the book. Sometimes there could be a useful summary but extrapolating more information from a summary in reverse is a difficult albeit useful problem. This could help us get a insight into the mind's thinking process.

Historically, Physicists have always tried to understand the deeper meaning of everything in the cosmos and how they came into being. Naturally they invented new words or used eponymns to define laws, constants or elements. If we can isolate the newly constructed infrequent words from a language and try to learn the process gone through to determine what we now know, we could map the qquality of a brain to fill in missing information and also have a valid way to test. If this works, we can allow a model to learn how to really fit a stock market predcition trend or create an introductory basis for undiscovered concepts in various field.
